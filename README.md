We began by creating a dataset using TIM proteins collected from multiple organisms. For each protein, we retrieved the corresponding cDNA sequences and structural data. Every residue in the structures was then converted into its torsion angles (Ï•, Ïˆ, and Ï‰).

To complement this, we incorporated codon usage information from **Kazusa** and **CodonDB**.

As a result, our final dataset contains, for each organism and its TIM protein:

* The codon sequence and corresponding amino acid (from cDNA and structure),
* The residueâ€™s torsion angles, and
* The codonâ€™s relative frequency based on codon usage tables.
